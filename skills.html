                    <div class="text">Python is the first programming language I learned, and I use it frequently due to its simplicity and the speed at which I can write scripts for various tasks. I’ve applied object-oriented programming (OOP) extensively in my projects, using classes to create modular and maintainable code.Over time, I’ve worked with a variety of libraries, including <b>bs4</b>, <b>json</b> and <b>requests</b> for Scrapping and API requests, <b>OpenCV</b> for computer vision, <b>NumPy</b> for numerical computations, <b>TensorFlow</b> and <b>PyTorch</b> for neural networks, <b>Pymem</b> for memory manipulation, as well as <b>Tkinter</b> for GUI applications. Python’s extensive ecosystem and flexibility make it my go-to language for rapid development and efficient solutions.</div>

                    <h2 class="category">Java (Advanced)</h2>
                    <div class="text">I’ve used Java extensively during my time at university, where it became the foundation for learning many core programming concepts, especialy <b>OOP</b>. Java was key in understanding and implementing various <b>design patterns</b>, and it was the language I used to solidify my knowledge of <b>data structures</b> like lists, queues, trees, and more. I also worked with libraries like <b>FreeTTS</b> to integrate text-to-speech functionality into applications. While I haven’t used Java much in personal projects, it remains the language where I have the deepest theoretical background, thanks to the comprehensive education and hands-on experience I’ve gained in it.</div>

                    <h2 class="category">C (Advanced)</h2>
                    <div class="text">I’ve used C primarily for systems-level programming, where I’ve developed a strong understanding of multithreading and multiprocessing using <b>pthread</b> and <b>OpenMP</b>, implementing <b>synchronization</b> mechanisms like mutexes to ensure thread safety in concurrent environments. My experience includes working with <b>operating system</b> fundamentals on UNIX, such as process <b>scheduling</b> and communication through system and kernel calls. C has been instrumental in helping me understand the basics of lower-level programming concepts and how systems interact with hardware, making it a valuable tool in my skill set.</div>

                    <div class="text">I have a solid understanding of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These core technologies allow me to create basic web pages and interfaces. Additionally, I have some experience with modern JavaScript frameworks such as <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>AngularTS</b>. During my internship, I worked with Angular and integrated <b>WebRTC</b> for real-time communication, further enhancing my understanding of dynamic web applications. While my experience in web development is at a basic level, I am familiar with essential concepts and tools for building and maintaining functional websites.</div>

                    <h2 class="category">Unity (Beginner)</h2>
                    <div class="text">I have beginner-level knowledge of Unity, using the engine for two university projects. The first was the <a class="styled-link" href="https://github.com/nikos-pap/Lab1-Graphics">Object Collision Demo</a>, where I explored <b>particle</b> generation, applied <b>physics</b>, and worked with <b>textures</b> and basic <b>3D objects</b>. In the second project, a collaborative Digital Museum demo with a large team, I delved into creating <b>multiple scenes</b>, designing simple <b>menus</b>, and working with <b>mesh</b> objects. One of my key contributions was building a model viewer that featured interactive rotation and zoom functionality. These projects gave me hands-on experience with Unity’s powerful tools for building immersive 3D environments.
